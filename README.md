# MongoDB Mojolicious Starter
This is meant to follow in the tradition of other similar starter packs,
giving a newcomer to Perl and Mojolicious a configuration which he or she
can use to build a simple application.

A package with similar goals is (sahat's "Hackathon Starter" repository for
Node.js)[https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter], which can be used
as a reference for the project goals.
